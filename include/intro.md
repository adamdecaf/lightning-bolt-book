## Introduction

Welcome to the Lightning Book of BOLTs, which is a streamlined guide to the [Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs)](https://github.com/lightning/bolts).

I want to be clear: I didn’t write the BOLTs. All the credit goes to the original authors and contributors of these notes. My contribution has been to organize these BOLTs into a single larger document.

Thanks for picking up this book! I hope it helps you navigate the exciting waters of Lightning more easily and encourages you to dive deeper into this innovative project. Let’s explore and build the future of decentralized communication together!
